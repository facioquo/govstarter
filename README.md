Crowd sourcing solutions for the biggest problems for government technology workers.

## origins

The government is notorious for its failure on software development projects. Over a brief term-limited tour-of-duty as a federal employee, I’d learned that the situation is much more complicated than you can imagine. Even with that experience, I still don't understand it well.

I was chatting with a friend who's about to embark on a similar journey. He suggested, “**_why don't we crowdsource ideas to fix it?_**” It’s an interesting thought. I do have some faith in the [wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd).

I know that any serious attempt to fixing the government's capability gap must also start with better information about root causes. But, what are they? In the end, solutions must also be _desirable_ to all participants, be viable options, and be feasible to implement -- all in the face of an incomprehensible, highly constrained, and often unknowable environment. No one person can understand it all, nor can one person fix it.

Is there a systemic way to get, aggregate, and analyze this kind of information? To validate assumptions? To arrive at actionable things to do? Who needs to do what, and when? Can technology help?

Food for thought.
